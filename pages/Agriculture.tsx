                                Indian horticulture sector contributes about 33%
                                to the agriculture Gross Value Added (GVA)
                                making very significant contribution to the
                                Indian economy. Apart from ensuring nutritional
                                security of the nation, it provides alternate
                                rural employment opportunities, diversification
                                in farm activities, and enhanced income to
                                farmers. India is currently producing about
                                320.48 million tones of horticulture produce
                                which has surpassed the food grain production,
                                that too from much less area (25.66 million Ha.
                                for horticulture against 127.6 M. ha. for food
                                grains). Productivity of horticulture crops is
                                much higher compared to productivity of food
                                grains (12.49 tones/ha against 2.23 tones/ha.).
                                India has emerged as world leader in the
                                production of a variety of fruits like mango,
                                banana, guava, papaya, sapota, pomegranate, Lime
                                & aonla and is the second largest producer of
                                fruits and vegetables. Besides, India has
                                maintained its dominance in the production of
                                spices, coconut and cashewnut. Among the new
                                crops, kiwi, gherkins, kinnow, date palm and oil
                                palm have been successfully introduced for
                                commercial cultivation in the country. Launch of
                                National Horticulture Mission has spurred the
                                production and productivity of horticultural
                                crops. Productivity of horticultural crops has
                                increased by about 38% between 2004-05 and
                                2019-20(2nd Advance Estimates). Increase in
                                demand for horticultural produce due to greater
                                health awareness, rising income, export demands
                                and increasing population poses the challenge
                                for further increasing the production and
                                productivity of horticultural crops. The issue
                                of climate change has thrown up greater
                                uncertainties and risks, further imposing
                                constraints on production systems.
